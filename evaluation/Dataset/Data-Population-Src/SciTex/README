HOW TO USE SCITEX:

Step 0. Be on a Linux machine. Or a Linux VM.

Step 1. Download CelloGraph from the CelloGraph github
            Download as a zip file, then unzip it to some folder ("folderX"). Unzipping creates a subfolder CelloGraph-main.

Step 2. Download grobid from the grobid github: https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid
            Download as a zip file, unzip it, then put it in the same folder ("folderX" from step 1).

Step 3. Take whatever pdfs you want translated, and put them into the CelloGraph-main/scitex/scitexIn folder

Step 4. Run CelloGraph-main/scitex/main.py from "folderX".

Step 5. The output should be .tei.xml files present in CelloGraph-main/scitex/scitexOut
            (if you want the input or output folders to be different, feel free to change scitex/main.py)


HOW TO READ THE CODE

main.py runs grobid on the input folder, then runs pdfalto on each pdf in the input folder, then runs scitex on the grobid and pdfalto outputs.

grobidAltoStuff/scitex.py is the file that contains the main scitex functions.
