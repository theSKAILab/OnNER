# OnNER ABox Generator

This tool, [`ABox-Generator.ipynb`](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER/blob/main/evaluation/source/ABox/ABox-Generator.ipynb), is part of the [OnNER](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER) ontology. It instantiates RDF triples (ABox) from scholarly publications.

The tool takes publications in XML format (generated by **SciTex**), performs Named Entity Recognition (NER), and generates RDF data in **Turtle** format. It produces two separate RDF files:
- One representing the structure of the document
- Another representing the recognized named entities

> **Note:** The NER model used for entity recognition is an experimental version. A more robust and refined model is currently under development.
