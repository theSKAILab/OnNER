# OnNER ABox Generator

This tool, [`ABox-Generator.ipynb`](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER/blob/main/evaluation/source/ABox/ABox-Generator.ipynb), is part of the [OnNER](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER) ontology. It instantiates RDF triples (ABox) from scholarly publications.

The tool takes publications in XML format (generated by [`SciTex`](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER/tree/main/evaluation/source/SciTex)), performs Named Entity Recognition (NER), and generates RDF data in Turtle format. It produces two separate RDF files:
- One representing the structure of the document
- Another representing the recognized named entities

> **Notes:** 
> - This tool can run independently and does not require [`SciTex`](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER/tree/main/evaluation/source/SciTex) to execute. [`SciTex`](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER/tree/main/evaluation/source/SciTex) is only needed to convert PDFs into XML format. The OnNER repository includes multiple pre-generated [`XML`](https://github.com/theSKAILab/OnNER/tree/main/evaluation/example/input) files.
> - The NER model used for entity recognition is an experimental version developed for the cellulosic materials domain. A more robust and refined model is currently under development. However, the system is designed to be flexibleâ€”any suitable NER model can be integrated to represent named entities in different domains.
