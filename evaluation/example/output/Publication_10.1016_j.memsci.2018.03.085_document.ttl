onner:paragraphText 'More than 1000 published experimental data of gas (O 2 and CO 2 ) and vapor (H 2 O) permeability in nanocomposites containing either spherical, elongated or platelet particles were collected, assorted and compared in order to decipher the role of particle shape on the reduction of the relative permeability of the nanocomposite. It is well known that inclusion of homogeneously dispersed and oriented impermeable fillers with high aspect ratio, such as platelets or elongated particles, should significantly increase the diffusion path of gas and vapors and yield to improve barrier properties. Results revealed that this expected impact was not systematically achieved, even for impermeable lamellar fillers that usually displayed the highest aspect ratio. More specifically, an unexpected increase of the permeability in the nanocomposite was often observed. To explain this deviation of the \'ideal behavior\', this paper discusses extensively the impact of the nanoparticle shape on the nanocomposite permeability along with structural aspects, related to both the particle nature and size, and the nanocomposite processing routes. Deviations from expected results of enhanced barrier effect are also discussed in correlation with unexpected variations in gas selectivity for O 2 /CO 2 pair. Lastly, this review aims at drawing meaningful conclusions on the structure/mass transfer relationships and giving directions for the development of the next generation of packaging materials with tailored mass transfer properties.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'In the objective of developing efficient and optimal packaging, one of the main challenges is to design and provide food packaging materials able to protect the food from the external environment and to maintain food quality and safety throughout its shelf life . The mass transfers are thus at the heart of the feature of the food packaging, especially transfers of water vapor, oxygen and/or carbon dioxide, which condition the rates of numerous reactions of food degradation (oxidation, microbial development, physiological reactions, etc.). The development of bulk nanocomposite structures by introducing nanoparticles, i.e. fillers having at least one dimension lower than 100 nm, in polymeric matrices appeared as one of the most promising directions in the development of packaging materials with advanced mass transfer properties. The expected role of these inclusions is to achieve a significant decrease of the mass transfer properties as compared to the neat matrix by acting as physical obstacles to the diffusion and permeation of diffusing molecules, which have to follow a more tortuous pathway. This phenomenon is called the tortuosity effect.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Many types of nanoparticles have already been tested to modulate mass transfer properties, with hundreds of permeability data published in literature. Nanoparticles can be classified into three major categories according to their particle shape (Fig. ): (i) isodimensional particles, that have the same size in all directions and an aspect ratio close to unity (such as spherical silica, TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, carbon black and fullerenes); (ii) elongated particles that consist in fibrils with a diameter ranging between 1 and 100 nm and length up to several hundred nanometers (such as carbon nanotubes or cellulose nanofibers); and (iii) layered particles that are characterized by one dimension ranging from several angstroms to several nanometers (such as layered silicates or starch nanocrystals). Among the three aforementioned types of particles, it is widely recognized that inclusion of impermeable platelets such as clays in the polymer should significantly enhance its barrier properties. However, an in-depth study of the available data in the literature revealed that it was not systematically the case and, even, on the contrary could lead to a deterioration of the barrier properties. Many reviews deal with the functional properties of nanocomposites, by mainly focusing on mechanical properties . Among these studies, some of them focused slightly on the mass transfer properties  but without deepening the topic. These studies generally focused on one type of nanoparticle, i.e. spherical nanoparticles or nano-platelets for instance, particularly for membrane applications. Few of them focused on food packaging applications . The last exhaustive review in the field is that of Cui et al.  that focused on gas barrier properties of clay-based polymer nanocomposites. However, the effect of the platelet-shape has never been compared and discussed along with results obtained with spherical and elongated particle shape. In spite of all these preceding reviews, there is still a huge lack of analysis of all available data in the perspective of deciphering the role of particle shape on the mass transfer properties of the resulting nanocomposite materials, even if it has been highlighted as a key input parameter in mathematical models. As far as we knew, there is no review that proposes an exhaustive analysis of the experimental permeability values from the available literature.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'In order to better correlate the mass transfer properties in nanocomposite materials with their multi-scale structure, the objective of the present review is to decipher and comprehensively discuss the role of the nanoparticle shape (either isodimensional, elongated or layered) on the modulation of the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites, as a function of filler volume fraction and in the light of the nanocomposite structure achieved. For that purpose, more than 1000 values (i.e. about 170 articles) of the 1995-2015 period containing measured values of O <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> O permeability in polymer-based nanocomposites were collected from the available literature and capitalized in a dedicated on-line database . All data could be uploaded from the permalink provided in figure caption (https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo.1136269). The proposed on-line database consists in the first and unprecedented compilation of permeability values for nanocomposite based materials. The current work is focused on direct analysis and comparison of experiments, without any mediation which could be provided by quantitative models. It must be specified that, in order to build up the database for analysis, which is of interest here, recent data for gas barrier in polymer based materials with dispersed graphene and graphene derivatives were not taken into consideration. In fact, while the latter represent nanocomposite materials with dispersed layered domains, the extremely high aspect ratio and flexibility of graphene layers reduces the threshold value for percolation in these materials to much lower values than in traditional layered particles nanocomposites . Under those conditions, in the volume concentration range for layered particles which is of reference in this work (in the order of 10% by volume) layers arrangement and layer defects are significantly more relevant to the barrier effect than the aspect ratio (particle shape) itself. For a comparison between gas barrier properties in polymer/clay and polymer/graphene nanocomposite see the review by Tan . For the above reason, although graphene has attracted much attention in recent years for the production of polymer based composites for packaging, analysis of pertinent results for gas barrier properties is left to a different discussion and the interested reader is addressed to recent reviews in the field .'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'All the processes used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites have already been extensively detailed in dedicated reviews and are not further detailed here. Examples of reference publications for layered silicates-based nanocomposites are those of Alexandre &amp; Dubois , Ray et al. , Pavlidou et al. , Mittal et al.  and Cui et al. , for natural fibre-based nanocomposites, those of Saheb et al.  and Siqueira et al.  and for inorganic spherical particle-based nanocomposites, those of Cong et al.  and Chung et al. . Due to the large range of polymer matrices and nanoparticles, different processing routes have been proposed to produce nanocomposites based on their convenience according to the nature of the raw constituents and their field of application (Fig. ). At laboratory scale, four main processes are most commonly used to prepare polymer-based nanocomposites from all the types of nanoparticles. Melt processing and solution blending are two processes based on the use of polymers, which lead to the formation of Van der Waals interactions between the constituents, while insitu polymerization and sol/gel methods are based on the use of monomers or oligomers, leading to the formation of covalent bonds between the polymer and the nanoparticles (Fig. ). At industrial scale, melt processing is generally preferred due to the difficulty to implement processes requiring the use of huge volumes of solvent.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'A great amount of effort has been made in the literature to describe the effect on transport properties of the inclusion of non-conducting particles into a conductive matrix and the effect of particle shape has been a focus since the beginning of these studies. Similar analyses of the problem can be found in the field of electrical properties (electrical conductivity/permittivity) as well as in that of heat or mass transfer (thermal conductivity/mass diffusivity). Exact solutions in terms of effective conductivity of the composite medium have been obtained already by Maxwell in 1873  for the case of dilute mixture of spherical domains ("non-interacting particles") perfectly adhering to the matrix. These exact solutions assume that the properties of dispersed and continuous phase in the composite are the same than the one measured in the corresponding pure materials ("ideal interface condition").'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Wiener  in 1912 extended the results to the case of dilute dispersion of long cylinders in the matrix, all aligned in the direction normal to the overall flux. While exact solutions are also available for the case of spheroids (dilute mixture, perfect alignment), empirical relations as well as numerical result have been discussed for the case of different shapes of the inclusions. Among the best, known results of this kind are those obtained by Nielsen  in 1967 following empirical ideas about the increase in contour length of path of diffusing molecules in the composite medium due to the presence of impermeable inclusions in the form of bricks. The specific expression for effective conductivity as function of particle concentration in the composite as derived from the above models is not here presented and discussed, as the direct comparison of available experimental results with model predictions is not relevant to this work. On the other hand, it is useful to remember here that all the above approaches consistently predict a decrease in the conductivity when the concentration of impermeable particles in the composite increases. In general terms, it can be said that, assuming ideal interface and non-interacting particle condition, the effective conductivity of the composite medium is expected to be half the value of the pure matrix when the concentration of dispersed phase approaches 40% vol for isometric particles, 30% vol for elongated particles aligned normally to the flux, and a much lower value, only few percent, depending on the exact shape, for layered particles lying in planes orthogonal to the flux.'^^xsd:string .

For this analysis, the range for P/P <sub>0</sub> was limited to a maximal value of 3, considering that a higher increase of the permeability ratio was an exceptional behavior.

For elongated nanoparticles, the same increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> is obtained but only for filler contents lower than 20 vol%. For higher filler contents, no clear tendency is evidenced, with a disordered shape of the curve. This could be due to agglomerated or percolated structures that become frequent for such high concentration in fillers whose effect on permeability is more unpredictable (Fig. ). Finally, for nanoplatelets-based nanocomposites, for filler contents lower than 5 vol%, the evolution of P/P <sub>0</sub> is the same as the general one previously observed on Fig.  and is characterized by a main peak (30% of data) centered on the class 0.6-0.8.

For filler content higher than 10 vol%, the decrease in permeability is not confirmed anymore.

onner:paragraphText '4.1.1.1. In-situ particle aspect ratio. The size aspect ratio of a nanoparticle is defined as the ratio of its longest dimension to its lowest dimension. Considering the different possible shapes of nanoparticles, it is obvious that the size aspect ratio of a sphere, equal to 1, is lower than that of elongated nanoparticles and nanoplatelets for which very high size aspect ratio could be achieved. The achievement of high size aspect ratios theoretically favors the establishment of a more tortuous pathway. This effect is all the greater for nanoplatelets that allow the creation of 2D obstacles. This has been experimentally validated by Gatos et al.  who prepared by melt processing fully-exfoliated nanocomposites from a hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber polymer and two layered silicates displaying different sizes, i.e. octadecylamine modified montmorillonites with a size aspect ratio of 100 and synthetic fluorohectorite with a size aspect ratio of 200. They observed that the highest decrease of oxygen permeability was achieved using the fluorohectorite as filler, which was ascribed to its higher aspect ratio . It must be noted that the achievement of such high in-situ size aspect ratios is exceptional. Indeed, the formation of stacks or tactoïds within the polymer matrix is usually obtained due to the agglomeration and/or incomplete exfoliation of nanoplatelets, resulting in a decrease of the theoretical size aspect ratio. An intercalated nanocomposite structure is thus less tortuous than a full-exfoliated structure. This implies that the in-situ size aspect ratio is usually different from the one of the native nanoparticle. As an example, Angellier-Coussy et al.  found average values of in-situ size aspect ratio of 17 and 23 for 10.8 and 2.2 vol% of filler, respectively in wheat gluten/montmorillonite based nanocomposites while the size aspect ratio of one native nanoparticle was about 80. This issue is the same for elongated nanoparticles where agglomeration often occurs.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'In practice, the knowledge of the in-situ size aspect ratio is thus necessary to fully understand and predict the impact of tortuosity on mass transfer properties. It is usually evaluated using image analysis of TEM pictures when nanoparticles can be easily distinguished from the matrix as is the case for montmorillonite . This analysis is tricky and time consuming. Indeed, a large number of images must be analyzed to obtain a significant representativeness of the whole material. In addition, it is well-known that TEM analysis has some inherent limitations due to the fact that it projects three-dimensional (3D) objects onto a two-dimensional (2D) plane, resulting in TEM cross-sections that do not necessarily represent the actual size of all the platelets . Furthermore, an ideal image would exhibit sharp transitions from black to white, what is not the case in reality, necessitating the conversion of the original grey-scale TEM micrograph into a black and white image using a semi-automated approach, this step being inevitably accompanied by errors. And finally, this evaluation must be done for each filler content, since the dispersion state strongly depends on the filler content. All these limitations probably explain why the evaluation of the in-situ size aspect ratio is rarely experimentally determined. It is usually an imprecise, unrealistic (if the size aspect ratio of the native nanoparticle is considered) or missing data.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText '4.1.1.3. Orientation. To obtain an optimal decreasing effect on permeability, the largest surface of each nanoparticle must be oriented perpendicular to the direction of the gas diffusion or permeation. Well-oriented and aligned particles perpendicularly to the permeation flux have more impact on the decrease of the permeability than disoriented particles as regards the tortuosity effect. This effect of orientation is only valid for elongated particles and nanoplatelets and, of course, all the more significant for particles with high size aspect ratios. This effect of orientation is also theoretically much more efficient for nanoparticles displaying high size aspect ratio in two dimensions (such as platelets) than only in one dimension (such as elongated particles). In practice, it is an extremely challenging task to achieve a regular arrangement of nanoparticles within the polymer matrix. It is strongly dependent on processing methods. Solution intercalation and in-situ-polymerization are more prone to produce nanostructures with well-aligned and oriented particles than melt intercalation as observed by several authors. It is all the more difficult that particles display high aspect ratio in 2dimension such as platelets. For example, Messersmith et al.  showed that montmorillonites adopted a planar orientation in the poly (ε-caprolactone) polymer matrix after in-situ-polymerization and solution casting processing while Sanchez-Garcia et al.  noted that it was difficult to obtain, using melt processing and compression moulding, well aligned and oriented montmorillonites in PHBV-PCL polymer and that a random orientation is at best the most often achieved.'^^xsd:string .

It is particularly true for highly interactive molecules such as water vapor that interacts though hydrogen bonding with hydrophilic sites. These sites bonded with the nanoparticles are not any more available for water sorption. Such changes in specific interactions between the migrant and the polymer were proposed to explain the decrease of water vapor permeability observed by Tunc et al.  in wheat gluten/montmorillonite or by Lee et al.  in soy protein/ montmorillonite nanocomposites.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'In some cases, the dispersion state of nanoparticles did not allow to achieve a sufficient tortuosity effect to slow down the diffusion of migrating molecules, especially for small molecules such as gases. Such an explanation is widely proposed to explain why values of permeability did not change or only slightly decreased in the nanocomposite as compared to the neat matrix. This has been, for example, proposed by Tunc et al.  to explain the constancy of O <sub>2</sub> permeability in wheat gluten/montmorillonite nanocomposites. In the same article, authors however demonstrated that the achieved tortuosity was nevertheless sufficient for decreasing permeability of bigger molecules such as aroma compounds. This highlighted that the nature, molecular weight and/or steric hindrance of the migrant are also key parameters governing the mass transfer properties in nanocomposites. 4.2.2. Macroscopic structural defects 4.2.2.1. Particle agglomeration. The presence of both nano-or microsized agglomerates and aggregates of particles could induce macroscopic structural defects, which play a major role in the increase of P/P <sub>0</sub> , as already shown for either spherical-based composites with SiO <sub>2</sub> (Cornelius et al. ), TiO <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (Zoppi et al. ) or cylinder-based composites with cellulose fibrils (Bilbao-Sainz et al. ). These agglomeration phenomena are related to a bad dispersion of the nanoparticles which is mainly ascribed to (1) mismatching of the particle polarity, as compared to that of the polymer, resulting in a low affinity between constituents and thus a poor particle/polymer adhesion  and/or (2) inefficiency of the elaboration technique to separate aggregates.'^^xsd:string .

All these mechanisms are not easily distinguished. Therefore, authors stressed an overall increase of free volume that they experimentally assessed by density measurements, without distinguishing all underlying mechanisms. Indeed, if the density of the nanoparticles, crystalline polymer and amorphous polymer phases has their pure component values in the nanocomposites, then the density of a nanocomposite sample, would be equal to the theoretical additive density.

Two studies nevertheless lead to an increase of the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction . In the work of Meera et al. , the decrease of permeability as a function of filler content is much higher for O <sub>2</sub> than for CO <sub>2</sub> leading to an increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permeability ratio while it seems to be the contrary for Merinska et al. . In the same time and for another combination of filler/polymer (Nanofill 5 as MMT/PP), the data of Merinska et al.  permitted to obtain a decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity. Alena et al.  also observed either an increase or decrease of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity depending on the type of nanoparticle (MMT) used in LDPE matrix. These last features confirm the random nature of the evolution of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction. We noted that this notion of permselectivity and its evolution as a function of filler content was never explained nor even highlighted by the aforementioned group of authors.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'For isodimensional particles-based nanocomposites, the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity is also centered around a value of 5 (Fig. ) and kept almost constant as a function of filler volume fraction. Nevertheless, a group of 5 studies displays very high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity (&gt; 15). Among this group of studies, we noted a general trend toward an increase of permselectivity with nanoparticle volume fraction (4 studies  observing an increase against only one  observing a decrease). Variation of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in the aforementioned studies was principally due to the fact that O <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> permeability did not decrease as much as a function of filler content resulting in a nonconstant PCO <sub>2</sub> /PO <sub>2</sub> ratio. Results of Zoppi et al.  and Kim et al.  with high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity were obtained on PEBAX® (copolymer with polyamide-6 and poly(ethyleneoxide)) which is known to display high CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in packaging application. These authors did not try to explain why the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity varied in their sample: Kim et al.  focused only on CO <sub>2</sub> /He, CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> selectivity and did not notice any variation of these selectivities as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction (about 6 for CO <sub>2</sub> /He, 70 for CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and 3 for O <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> respectively); Zoppi et al.  focusing on O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /H <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not notice so much variation of this value as a function of nanoparticle content except for very high volume ratio (15 vol/vol%). Only Semsarzadeh et al.  calculated the CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in their study on polyurethane-silica/polyvinyl alcohol mixed matrix membranes. They noticed that by increasing the silica content in membranes, all gas permselectivities including CO <sub>2</sub> , namely CO <sub>2</sub> /N <sub>2</sub> , CO <sub>2</sub> /CH <sub>4</sub> and CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> increased much more than selectivity including other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> / N <sub>2</sub> , up to 136%, 69% and 47%, respectively. They explained that, while O <sub>2</sub> , N <sub>2</sub> and CH <sub>4</sub> displayed decreasing permeability, CO <sub>2</sub> permeability demonstrated an increase upon increasing silica content due to an increase in the number of the active sites (polar OH groups) for gas dissolution in polymer matrix. The same reduced decrease in CO <sub>2</sub> permeability compared to other gases such as O <sub>2</sub> or N <sub>2</sub> was observed by Sadeghi et al.  in polyether-based polyurethane-silica and polyurethane-silica nanocomposite leading to moderate increase of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity as a function of nanoparticle content (Fig. ).'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'The comparative examination of permeability and selectivity variation of data collected in the database considered in this work is now in order. Indeed, for the case of inclusion of impermeable particles in a permeable polymer matrix, the anticipated mechanism of induced tortuosity in path of gas molecules is expected to reduce the permeability of different gases by the same extent. A further analysis was thus performed to explore possible correlation between relative permeability and permselectivity in the available set of data. The examination is confined to the case of CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in nanocomposite obtained from the inclusion of isodimensional or platelet shaped nanoparticles, as only for those cases is a sufficient number of data available to insure the significance of the statistical analysis. In Fig.  the relative permeability for CO <sub>2</sub> in the nanocomposites is related to the corresponding square variation of permselectivity δ defined as follows:'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'where α <sub>NC</sub> and α <sub>M</sub> are CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> permselectivity in nanocomposite and neat matrix, respectively. Despite the scattering, data in Fig.  put in evidence that, both for the case of isodimensional particles and platelets, relative permeability higher than one is typically accompanied by a significant deviation of nanocomposite permselectivity from the value of neat matrix, while an interval exists for relative permeability of nanocomposite moderately lower than 1, for which the deviation in permselectivity from the value of neat matrix is negligible. Significantly, the above interval for relative permeability extends to lower values for the case of nanocomposites including platelets with respect to the case of isodimensional particles. It can be thus concluded that a good number of studies considered in this work shows results which are at least qualitatively consistent with the picture resulting from the tortuosity effect induced by the dispersed phase to the motion of gas molecules. On the other hand, a large number of nanocomposites exhibiting either relative permeability values higher than one or very low seems to be often characterized by significant variation of the permselectivity, indicating the relevance of additional phenomena hiding the effect of a pure increase in tortuosity path for the motion of gas molecules in the system. As it can be seen in Fig. , data available to calculate H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity are much scarcer than for CO <sub>2</sub> /O <sub>2</sub> and, for this reason, the correlation between relative permeability and deviation of permselectivity is not discussed here for this kind of data. No values were even found in the collected references for calculated H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity in iso-dimensional nanoparticle based nanocomposites. Only three references were found for elongated ones. O <sub>2</sub> permeability is rarely investigated concomitantly to H <sub>2</sub> O permeability although H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity is a very important value in many applications such as packaging where sometimes a high barrier property to O <sub>2</sub> is required at the same time as low barrier to H <sub>2</sub> 0. From Fig. , it can be concluded that the H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity did not vary so much as a function of nanoparticle volume fraction except for the study of Kasirga et al. , Chang et al.  and Lee et al.  where H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity tended to dramatically increase then decrease for at least Chang et al.  and Lee et al. . Even if none of these authors intentionally measured nor explained the evolution of H <sub>2</sub> O/O <sub>2</sub> selectivity, this behavior could be generally ascribed to a better tortuosity effect obtained for H <sub>2</sub> O than for O <sub>2</sub> and, for non-monotonic behavior, to nonlinear decrease in permeability with clay loading.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'This review has revealed that despite numerous and intensive studies on the optimization of nanocomposite processing and structure in the perspective of modulating their barrier properties, the expected decreasing effect on the permeability is often not so high as expected and sometimes completely the opposite. This review confirmed that layered nanoparticles are more efficient than isodimensional and elongated nanoparticles to decrease the relative permeability (P/P <sub>0</sub> ). But, this effect is difficult to anticipate due to numerous interfering mechanisms that provoke modifications of tortuosity, sorption, polymer matrix (crystallinity, free volume, molar mass), creation of an interphase, voids and cracks, and more that lead to unexpected behaviors of the permeability in nanocomposites. Investigation of the selective transport of CO <sub>2</sub> to O <sub>2</sub> and H <sub>2</sub> 0 to O <sub>2</sub> did not reveal a general trend either and it is also difficult to anticipate.'^^xsd:string .
