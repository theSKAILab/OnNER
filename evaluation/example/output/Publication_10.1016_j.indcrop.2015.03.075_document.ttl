onner:paragraphText 'This work was aimed to evaluate the performance of two different surface modifications on cellulose nano-particles obtained from blue agave bagasse. Cellulose nanofibers were obtained from traditional mechanical methods, and cellulose nanocrystals were obtained via sulfuric acid hydrolysis. After cellulose extraction and size reduction, different composites were elaborated using poly(lactic acid) as matrix varying fiber concentrations and using cellulosic particles of diverse size and surface modification (3aminopropyl triethoxysilane silanized cellulose nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride esterified cellulose nanocrystals). Non-cellulosic elimination and the effect of surface modifications were analyzed with infrared analysis, showing characteristic intensities for cellulosic species and new peaks for each modification (characteristic ester peak ∼1740 cm −1 , and amino peak ∼1550 cm −1 ) cellulose nanofibers and nanocrystals were observed with atom-force microscopy; crystallinity of nano-scale cellulose before and after modifications was obtained with X-ray diffraction to analyze the performance of the modifications. Composites were tested with stress-strain standard methods showing better mechanical properties when surface modifications were performed and the amount of filler was 0.5 wt% reaching an increase in strain to fracture of more than 20%.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Poly(lactic acid) or polylactide (PLA) is one of the most studied polymeric materials in the last two decades , even though until now, most of the PLA used in industry and scientific research has been obtained from petroleum, the feasibility of obtaining PLA from renewable resources makes it an interesting biopolymer for its study. Nevertheless, the slightly minor mechanical properties of PLA in respect to current used polymer mattresses , brings up the need to develop composite materials with determined characteristics in order to modify the behavior of PLA toward certain circumstances or applications.'^^xsd:string .

Within the many possibilities of use that enclosures agricultural biomass, the obtention of bioplastics has increased attention from the scientific community, the possibility of reinforcing for biopolymers such as PLA to enhance its natural physical or chemical properties has boosted a wide series of researches. Among those who represent a most suitable option in elaborating biocomposites with this kind of plastics, are lignocellulosic materials, as they can be degraded or composted and present good behavior either as filler or as blend , the present study pretends to evaluate the performance of cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals as fillers, either rough or after a surface modification with an hydrophobic additive.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'One of the most used methods to obtain nanocrystalline particles is with sulfuric acid hydrolysis . In this process, sulfation occurs via condensation-esterification on the surface of cellulose nanocrystals, which displays a high surface area with a high amount of hydroxyl groups available that can react with the H <sub>2</sub> SO <sub>4</sub> molecule with the aid of another H <sub>2</sub> SO <sub>4</sub> molecule as condensation agent, thus forming a stable and well dispersed aqueous colloidal suspension as the result of the negative charge of the sulfated surface , this polar condition causes agglomeration during drying and aggregation in non-polar matrices because of the formation of additional hydrogen bonds between amorphous parts of the nanoparticles, making desirable a surface modification to optimize the fiber dispersion inside a polymeric matrix .'^^xsd:string .

Silane chains can improve matrix-filler interactions either as suspension in organic solvents or added as bulk into the polymeric matrix  by serving as a coupling agent between the cellulosic filler and the polymeric matrix. On her behalf, esteric stabilization of cellulose nanocrystals with different fatty acids has shown good properties forming continuous composites with polymer matrices, as they show high degree of substitution when the esterification is performed both at the fiber surface and in the inner layers; resulting in a heterogeneous esterification, causing de-crystallization of cellulose which enhances hydrophobicity and bonds between the matrix and the cellulose fiber, in expense of thermal stability of the cellulose .'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'The objective of this work is to develop new composites using PLA as matrix, by adding as fillers modified cellulose nanofibers and nanocrystals obtained from agricultural waste of a highly fibrous plant (Agave tequilana) in order to give value added applications to an undervalued material. On the other hand, PLA properties require improvements to compete with other plastics, making important the exploration of new surface modifications in polymer reinforcements in order to increase mechanical and hydrophobic properties of PLA and to enhance the interaction between nano fillers and the matrix, avoiding the formation of dislocations in the interaction surface. Two different surface modifications on two cellulose nanoparticles (CNF and CNC) were evaluated to determine the improvements that these modifications provide to the cellulose surface, they were also compared to raw blue agave bagasse and to bleached pulp to analyze if working on nano-scale was relevant.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Chemical composition of the agave bagasse used in this work was analyzed according to international standards and consists of 54.60 ± 1.7 cellulose, 16.2 ± 0.48 lignin, 13.95 ± 0.28 hemicelluloses 4.50 ± 0.07 ashes 8.35 ± 0.39 hot water extractives and 5.42 ± 0.23 ethanol-toluene extractives. The measurements were made from the bagasse as received from the distillery and the presented values are the mean result of six tests for each standard method. High content of cellulose can be observed, making it a desirable raw material for cellulose nano-particle extraction. The amount of lignin present in the raw material makes desirable a pulping process, being selected NaOH 1.8 M as the most suitable for this circumstance. PLA was received in the form of pellets with a 99 wt% content of l-poly-lactide and 250 ppm H <sub>2</sub> O, the specific gravity given by the supplier is 1.24.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'After the elimination of non-cellulosic components of the agave bagasse, bleached pulp was analyzed with ATR-IR to determine the quality of the obtained cellulose, in Fig. , it can be observed the ATR-IR spectra of cellulose from agave bagasse (a) showing peaks associated to high purity cellulose. Signals between 3600 and 3000 cm <super>−1</super> correspond to OH vibration in cellulose; the band between 3000 and 2600 cm <super>−1</super> corresponds to asymmetric and symmetric C H stretching vibration present in cellulose (1-2), moreover, the peaks present at ∼1430, ∼1162 and ∼1111 cm <super>−1</super> (a-5 to a-6) are assigned to CH <sub>2</sub> symmetric bending, asymmetric C O C bridge stretching, anhydroglucose ring asymmetric stretching, respectively, this is associated with the crystalline part of the cellulose, the peak at ∼893 cm <super>−1</super> is assigned to C H deformation of cellulose associated to the non-crystalline cellulose . In both silanized (b) cellulose nanofibers and esterified (c) cellulose nanocrystals, it can be observed the changes in the behavior of these bands because of the modification of the free hydroxyl present in the natural cellulose, that have reacted with the amino group in the case of ATS and the aliphatic acid chains in the case of DDC. Peaks at ∼2854 (c-1) and ∼2923 cm <super>−1</super> (c-2) correspond to the C H band, belonging to aliphatic acid chains, also a new peak can be observed at ∼1743 cm <super>−1</super> (c-3) corresponding to the 1750-1735 cm <super>−1</super> ester carbonyl band , this three peaks that occur in characteristic bands of DDC prove the successful esterification of the CNC. In the silanized CNF spectrum it can be observed a new peak at ∼1550 cm <super>−1</super> (b-4) that corresponds to the amino scissoring bending vibration, also in the 1300-1000 cm <super>−1</super> band (b-5 to b-6) there is an increase in the cellulose peaks because of the chemisorbed ATS related to the Si O Si bonding , therefore it can be assumed that a proper surface modification was performed on both CNC and CNF.'^^xsd:string .

The action of sulfuric acid in the cellulose fibers allowed the isolation of cellulose nanocrystals (b) with an average width of 33 ± 13 nm and length 350 ± 153 nm with a very homogenized shape. In the case of cellulose nanofibers (a), the action of the high pressure homogenization allowed to tear microfibrillated cellulose into single nanofibers or groups of 2-3 nanofibers attached; in this case, shape is less constant as fibers are presented sometimes separated in one of their ends but still attached in the other, this because mechanical isolation methods do not eliminate amorphous cellulose that can still be left after the bleaching processes, anyhow the average length was 607 ± 85 nm and the average width 68 ± 22 nm. In both cases aspect ratio left a large amount of surface able to modify images (c) and (d) show silanized nanofibers and esterified nanocrystals, respectively, it can be clearly observed the surface modification and the formation of particle aggregates.'^^xsd:string .

Broadened peaks are associated to the presence of non-crystalline particles in the powder sample, this can be observed in the BAST sample, in which peaks at 2Â = 14.9, 17.41 and 22.36 • present low intensity and broadened peaks, this can be related to either hemicelluloses or amorphous cellulose as it has been suggested in previous reports  that this fiber components give broadened peaks.

onner:paragraphText 'In Table , the estimated crystallinity and apparent crystallite size are presented (left) peak deconvolution method with Voigt fitting curve can be useful for qualitative comparison of the behavior of cellulose during a series of treatments. It can be observed a considerable increase in crystallinity after the pulping and bleaching methods (between BAST and BABP) that happens when amorphous lignin and hemicelluloses are discarded from the original fibers, after mechanical homogenization there is no significant increase  in crystallinity as the chemical structure of the fiber is not attacked during this process, this can also be seen in the apparent crystallite size, as even after mechanical treatments the size of the crystallite is in the same range. BANC obtained after hydrolysis present the highest relative crystallinity (an increase of ∼10% respect to bleached cellulose) as the hydrolysis effectively eliminates amorphous cellulose from the fibers, leaving crystalline cellulose and in consequence, the range of crystallite size is decreased.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'In case of modified cellulose, the surface modification performed in each sample generated a new amorphous region around the crystalline cellulose by hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups present in the exterior chains of the molecular wall. XRD results concur with previous AT-IR analysis respecting the formation of a new surface in cellulose. In the case of BANS, it can be appreciated a slight increase in the crystallite size as a result of the addition of amino chains to the crystalline region; in Fig. ,  the peak deconvolution for the BANS (lower right) signal shows three new low-signal broad peaks at 2Â = 24.97, 30.25 and 37.67 • with an average H of 4.1 ± 0.56 • . For the BADC sample, the addition of large aliphatic chains generates a whole new region around the crystal particles; this can be concluded as the estimated crystallite size is 53% bigger than the original BANC sample. This new aliphatic chains in the crystalline surface diminish the crystallinity of the modified cellulose as the morphology is altered . In Fig.  (upper right) the deconvoluted peaks for the BADC sample shows a new low-intensity peak at 2Â = 7.99 • that is in the range of the associated diffraction of aliphatic chains for a number of carbons higher than 7 . There are also new peaks at 2Â = 25.26 and 28.44 • that broaden the base of the peaks corresponding to cellulose at the 0 0 2 plane. Surface modification increases the hydrophobicity of cellulose fibers; contact angle provides further information respecting the interaction between the surface of the CNC and CNF and the hydrophobic agent. Table  presents the contact angles (Â <sub>w</sub> ) of cellulose after bleaching as well as modified CNC and CNF. When comparing Â <sub>w</sub> for BAST and BABP, it can be seen a decay on contact angle, this proves the typical hydrophilic character of cellulose. The increase in Â <sub>w</sub> is related to the topology of the surface, either because of the size of the particle avoid the surface roughness or because of the reaction of hydroxyl groups with non-polar particles, even though during surface modification not all hydroxyl groups may react, the possibility of water molecules to penetrate the substrate when dealing at nano-scale is reduced. It can be seen in the BADC sample that the hydrophobic character is increased (Â <sub>w</sub> ∼81.06 • ), while for unmodified bleached cellulose was ∼31.74 • . In case of the ATS modified cellulose, it can be observed a n increase in the surface hydrophobicity of ∼31.45 • more than unmodified cellulose, but still is less than in the case of BADC, this is related to the features associated with the components of the respective modification, as well as with the specific surface of the particle; nano-scale cellulose has more hydroxyl groups to react with, this groups have strong hydrogen bonding with the surface modification agent that generates a shield against water sorption .'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Table  presents the data corresponding to ultimate tensile strength and strain at break results for the different elaborated composites and Fig.  shows characteristic Tensile-Stress graphs for each composite. The addition of anisotropic material to the polymeric matrix influences the performance in uniaxial stress . It can be observed a considerable decrease of the mechanical properties when adding cellulose without any surface modification in composites reinforced with bleached pulp, cellulose nanofibers and cellulose nanocrystals, in which ultimate tensile strength (UTS) presents a decrease from the 45.29 MPa that has the PLA without any filler; this is accentuated as the percent of filler is increased, reaching a drop of approximately 25% when the filler reaches 2% of the composite. In general, the behavior of composites under uniaxial   stress is similar to the obtained in previous publications, with an increase in the UTS and a decrease in the strain at fracture when cellulosic fillers are added . Qualitative analysis shows differences with previously reported works with another type of cellulose modifications in which tensile stress and modulus are higher but the strain at break is considerably lower  this kind of variations and the ones presented in this wok reflect the importance that the surface modification of cellulose has in the elaboration of composites. In case of BANF and BANC, both have similar UTS values and are higher than those of bleached pulp. On the other hand, PLA composites reinforced with modified nano-particles have better UTS than any other and are slightly better in the case of BADC. With regard to the strain at fracture, ductility of PLA is decreased when mixed with more crystalline material, this particularity can be observed with more clearness in the PLA-BANC composite in which the average maximum elongation is dropped by an average of 48% from the unfilled PLA, as the stronger bonds between the highly crystalline cellulose inhibit the elongation of the fiber. The addition of noncrystalline components to the surface of CNF and CNC enhances the interaction between the filler and the matrix, allowing a better displacement in the axial direction under tension, with strain being increased by ∼18% in the case of 0.5% BADC and ∼25% in the case of 0.5% BANS composites; this value gradually descends as the amount of filler represents a higher percent in the composite, as either 1% and 2% concentrations of BANS and BADC have lower values for maximum strain than PLA without fillers. The behavior of all composites shows a mechanical decay when the amount of filler is increased, this situation can be related with the morphology and the composition of the filler as amorphous parts of BABP, BANF and BAST; lignin content in BAST and coupling agents in BADC and BANC benefit the interactions between crystalline cellulose and PLA; but when the share of the filler inside the composite is increased, the anisotropy characteristic to organic fillers in polymeric matrices, gets a major role in the response of the composite to uniaxial stress, generating more dislocations inside the composite. Furthermore, higher amount of filler material can generate agglomerations that result in a deterioration of tensile stress transfer between matrix and filler, generating a more brittle structure .'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Six different composites were elaborated using PLA as a matrix and blue agave bagasse as raw material. To study the relevance of composition and surface modification in natural fibers, different chemical and mechanical treatments were performed. The analysis of composites made with the same material throughout the complete process can help to determine the relevance and feasibility of the treatments and then decide if whether or not is worthy. Hydrophilic character of cellulose surface was modified with 3aminopropyl triethoxysilane in case of nanofibers and dodecanoyl chloride in case of nanocrystals. The behavior toward contact angle and tensile tests showed the potential of these modifications as suitable methods to enhance mechanical properties and hydrophobicity because of the formation of non-polar covalent bonding between free hydroxyl and coupling agents, also enhancing dispersion inside the matrix, this has an important potential in creating barrier materials to avoid contact with water. Exists an inversely proportional relation between the amount of filler and the uniaxial mechanical properties, this can be related to agglomerations and the anisotropy of the filler inside the matrix, also the addition of nano-scale particles enhanced the interaction between matrixfiller. Thermal properties showed a better crystallization of the PLA chains when reinforcements were added without affecting the final crystallinity of the polymer.'^^xsd:string .
