onner:paragraphText 'The microstructure of CNC particles depends strongly on the drying method employed during manufacturing. The effect of different drying techniques, including spray drying, freeze drying, and spray freeze drying (SFD), on microstructure of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) particles was studied. Conventional drying methods (i.e. spray and freeze drying) yielded packed and dense agglomerates of CNC. Capillary forces and ice crystal growth play key roles in CNC aggregation during spray and freeze drying, respectively. It was found that, in the absence of these forces, in the SFD technique, the dispersed state of CNC in water could be frozen in. Thus, SFD of CNC suspension resulted in a powder with porous structure. A filament-like agglomerate structure consisting of nanofibers was formed at low CNC concentrations (ca. b2 wt.%), while a spherical foam structure was obtained at higher CNC concentrations. Polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites containing spray dried CNC, freeze dried CNC, and spray freeze dried CNC (CNCSFD) were prepared via melt mixing in an internal batch mixer. Optical light and scanning electron microscopy coupled with rheological properties showed better dispersion of CNCSFD agglomerates. Moreover, PP samples containing CNCSFD showed significant increases in mechanical properties.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'CNC nanoparticles have high specific surface area and surface energy. Consequently, they aggregate and form larger particles during and/ or in the last step of the production process. After separation from other impurities and amorphous cellulose, CNC is obtained as an aqueous suspension. However, there are a variety of applications where CNC is needed in the powder form. Such applications include the preparation of polymeric nanocomposites in hydrophobic polymer matrices using melt processing. Moreover, transportation of CNC in the powder state reduces transportation costs. Therefore, a drying step is required to obtain dry CNC powder from the aqueous suspension. For CNC aqueous suspension, conventional drying methods such as spray and freeze drying have been employed . In the spray drying method, CNC suspension is atomized inside a drying chamber where hot air (higher than 100 °C) is used as the drying atmosphere which results in a powder with particle sizes in micron size range. Freeze drying or lyophilization is a drying process that occurs at low temperature by sublimation and is suitable for thermosensitive materials. Spray freeze drying (SFD) is a cryogenic atomization technique consisting of two main steps: (i) an aqueous solution is atomized directly/indirectly into a cryogenic liquid, such as liquid nitrogen, and (ii) freeze drying of the frozen suspension below the triple point of water. This technique has been used in the ceramic, food and pharmaceutical industries . However, to our knowledge, it has not been used in conjunction with CNC.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Most attempts to prepare polymer/CNC nanocomposites via melt mixing were not successful to disperse CNC and therefore enhance mechanical properties of polymer . Therefore, most polymer nanocomposite preparations with CNC have been limited to solution mixing . One of the challenges in polymer nanocomposite field is nanoparticle dispersion evaluation in polymer matrices. This becomes a severe challenge for CNC as an organic nanoparticle dispersed in an organic medium such as polymer matrices. Thus, microscopy as a direct and conventional tool for dispersion is limited for polymer/CNC nanocomposites. On the other side, rheology as a sensitive tool to nanoparticle dispersion could be employed as a complementary technique.'^^xsd:string .

The porous CNC micro-particles (agglomerates) obtained by SFD could be used in applications where porosity is of interest, such as polymer nanocomposites, drug delivery, scaffolds, and catalysts. In a previous study , we found that thermodynamic analysis of energy requirements is not sufficient to achieve good dispersion of CNC in polymer melts, because kinetics factors should be also taken into consideration. Therefore, the relation between CNC agglomerate structure and its dispersibility in polymer matrices is analyzed, with due consideration to particle strength and polymer diffusion standpoint. The morphological, rheological, and mechanical properties of polymer nanocomposites containing CNC agglomerates prepared with different drying techniques (SD, FD, and SFD) are also investigated.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Inter-nanoparticle forces and interaction energy play an important role in the preparation of polymer nanocomposite systems. The magnitude of van der Waals interaction energy and forces between two isolated nanoparticles depends on the geometry of nanoparticles, as well as inter-particle distance. CNC can be considered as a cylindrical nanoparticle with 7 nm radius and 150 nm length . Table  shows equations and estimates for inter-particle interaction energy and force between two cross and parallel CNC cylindrical particles. U <sub>i</sub> , F <sub>i</sub> , A <sub>H</sub> , R, L, and z are the van der Waal interaction energy between particles, inter-particle force, Hamaker constant, particle radius, cylinder length, and interparticle distance, respectively.

onner:paragraphText 'where D <sub>0</sub> and γ are the theoretical molecular distance between two particles in contact, known as "cutoff", 0.165 nm, and surface energy of CNC at 190 °C , respectively. The inter-particle van der Waals interaction energy and force between nanoparticles depend on the orientation of the individual nanoparticles. Inter-particle energy of two parallel and cross cylinders is comparable to or stronger than inter-molecular energy such as hydrogen bond energy (3.48 × 10 <super>−</super> <super>20</super> J) and C\C covalent bond energy (5.98 × 10 <super>-19</super> J) . It is also noteworthy that CNC nanoparticles can interact via hydrogen bonding. The number of hydroxyl groups per unit surface area (7.2 OH/nm <super>2</super> ) was calculated based on CNC unit cell. Also, the hydrogen bonding interaction energy associated with the hydroxyl groups on the CNC surface for two CNC nanoparticles in contact with parallel orientation (Table ) is estimated to be 7.5 × 10 <super>−16</super> J . This interaction energy is almost two orders of magnitude higher than van der Waals colloidal energy. However, hydrogen bonding energy interactions are short range (less than 0.32 nm) compared to the longer range colloidal van der Waals energy (up to 100 nm). At very small inter-particle distance, hydrogen bond interaction is predominant, but at higher separation distance, the major interaction energy is due to colloidal van der Waals interactions. CNC surface modification (covalent and non-covalent methods) is employed to overcome hydrogen bonding interactions and thus to improve CNC dispersion in polymer matrices. Modifiers could also increase inter-particle distance between CNC nanoparticles. Thus, according to Table , van der Waals interactions become lower. Unlike interaction energy, the force required to separate nanoparticles depends on the path or method of separation . In the case of cylindrical shape nanoparticle (CNC in this work), the orientation of nanoparticles in the flow field determines ease or feasibility of separation.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'CNC nanoparticles with parallel orientation can be separated in two ways: pulling and peeling (Fig. ). In the pulling mechanism, the separation route is perpendicular to the surface. In fact, contact area is constant but the equilibrium distance gradually increases. Therefore, the required hydrodynamic force to fully separate two parallel CNC particles is 115 nN (see Table ). The pulling mechanism is very fast and rapid. It is known in dispersion literature as the breakup/rupture mechanism (discussed later). However, in the case of peeling, the applied force is spent on reducing contact area between the two parallel CNC nanoparticles. Thus, the force required to fully separate the CNC particles is much less than the pulling force:'^^xsd:string .

If this amount of force is provided by employing a very strong mixing element/accessory, polymer chain scission can occur during pulling. As a result, there is no guarantee that all agglomerated nanoparticles will separate during mixing, and some of them remain intact. However, not all CNC particles are in parallel orientation. Other alignments (such as cross) need less hydrodynamic pulling force to be separated (see Table ).'^^xsd:string .

Fig.  shows agglomerate strength versus particle radius according to Eq. ( ) for CNC nanoparticles at 190 °C, where typical polymer-filler mixing usually takes place. It shows that agglomerate strength increases as agglomerate radius decreases. At the beginning of mixing process when particle size is large, hydrodynamic forces are higher than cohesion forces. Thus, particle de-aggregation takes place via the breakup mechanism . In other words, at the beginning of the mixing process, agglomerates are weak and they can be easily broken. However, particle strength becomes higher than hydrodynamic forces as particle size is reduced below a certain size. It has been suggested that the erosion mechanism becomes the dominant mechanism of particle size reduction at this point . The erosion mechanism is very slow, in comparison to the rapid breakup mechanism. Various approaches are used to facilitate breakup and erosion, such as increasing residence time, using different types of mixing elements, rotor speed, and feeding rate, in addition to using compatibilizer and masterbatch preparation .'^^xsd:string .

The shape of CNC particles is not a round sphere, due to shrinkage during the spray drying procedure. Similar agglomerate characteristics for spray dried CNC have been reported . A broad range of CNC particle sizes (ca. 5-30 μm) is observed in Fig. . The structural characteristics of spray dried CNC particles are controlled by four forces: capillary, van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, and electrostatic repulsion forces. The first three forces cause CNC nanoparticles to collide, while electrostatic repulsion caused by the negative charge on CNC surface balances over aggregation. Therefore, fast aggregation cannot occur and nanoparticles have enough time to reach the best orientation, for energy minimization before collision. In other words, a random collision cannot take place, which results in a compact and dense powder. The product of the spray drying technique is a powder consisting of compact particles due to capillary, van der Waals and hydrogen forces attracting nanoparticles during drying. The powder particle size becomes smaller than the initial drop size due to evaporation and the capillary effect involved in spray drying technique. The diffusion of a hydrophobic polymer melt into packed spray dried CNC particles (agglomerates) is very difficult. Thus, it allows relatively small contact area between the polymer and CNC. This would require large hydrodynamic forces to cause breakdown of particles to a size or structure that would allow larger surface contact.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Fig.  shows SEM images of spray freeze dried CNC from aqueous suspension at two different concentrations: 0.5 and 1 wt.%. Henceforth, they are referred to as CNCSFD0.5 and CNCSFD1, respectively. As illustrated, at low concentrations (ca. b 2 wt.%), a porous agglomerated CNCs in a filament-like structure,(consisting of interconnected nanofibers) of CNC was created (Fig. ) Hereafter in this manuscript referred to as "filament-like agglomerates. In this concentration regime, there was no structural integrity due to the low number density of CNC nanoparticles inside the drops. In other words, there were not enough nanoparticles to preserve the spherical shape of drops after the atomizer. Fibers in CNCSFD0.5 were connected and have a high aspect ratio (if applicable), in comparison with CNC individual nanoparticles (Figs. ). The fibers in CNCSFD0.5 had thickness in the range of ca. 10-30 nm (minimum and maximum). The length cannot be readily estimated as the fibers were connected, but it appears to be in micron scale. Similar structure was observed in CNCSFD1 particles (Fig. ). The thickness of fibers was in the range of ca. 20-65 nm range (minimum and maximum). It is higher than that in CNCSFD0.5, due to a higher CNC number density in CNCSFD1. Thus, there are more chances for CNC aggregation before or during freezing. The driving force for nanoparticle assembly is not capillary forces anymore. Similar to freeze drying, the main driving force for CNC aggregation is ice crystal growth (solidification) which causes the dispersed phase to collide and agglomerate. The size of crystals and the growth rate depend on the cooling rate. However, in comparison with freeze drying, much less aggregation is expected to occur due to high rapid cooling rate.'^^xsd:string .

Pore sizes were less than 350 nm in the case of CNCSFD2 (Fig. ), and some particles were broken up either during spraying or sample preparation for SEM characterization.

onner:paragraphText 'The BET technique allows the estimation of pore size and surface area by measuring the specific amount of adsorption/desorption of nitrogen gas. As mentioned earlier, depending on CNC concentration in the SFD method, different structures were formed. The interpretation and comparison of BET data of these structures are difficult. Fig.  shows BET results for spray dried CNC (as received), freeze dried CNC, CNCSFD0.5, CNCSFD2, and CNCSFD6. For CNCSFD0.5 and CNCSFD1 with a filament-like agglomerate structure (see Fig.  definition of pore geometry is quite challenging. Pores usually have geometry such as regular or irregular cylindrical, cavities, cracks, and rugged areas connected to the surface of the material. In effect, in the BET technique, nitrogen gas is adsorbed on pore walls and starts to cover the pores. The specific area is estimated based on the amount of adsorbed gas. This could explain the low value of BET surface area (less than 1 m <super>2</super> /g) for freeze and spray dried CNC, because nitrogen gas adsorption, if any, can occur just on the external surface area of micron size particles, shown in Figs. . Likewise, in CNCSFD0.5, nanoscale fibers (Fig. ) can act as substrate for gas adsorption and a higher value of BET surface area (20 m <super>2</super> /g) was obtained, due to more accessible area for gas adsorption. Unlike CNCSFD0.5 particles, the word "pore" is more meaningful for CNCSFD2 and CNCSFD6 particles, since there are internal surfaces connected to external surface of the particles. It is not logical to compare BET results of these structures with that in CNCSFD0.5, in which there was no internal structure. CNCSFD2 had a higher value of BET surface area (ca. 42 m <super>2</super> /g) than that of CNCSFD6 (ca. 35 m <super>2</super> /g). It could be due to the smaller pore size in CNCSFD2 which resulted in a higher BET surface area. It should be noted that BET can detect micropores (less than 2 nm) and mesopores (between 2 and 500 nm). Hence, macropores (higher than 500 nm) should not be considered in this technique. The space between lamellae (which is in the micron size) in Figs.  can act as micro-channels for adsorption, which is not taken into account in the BET method.'^^xsd:string .

Fig.  shows the results for the tensile strength, tensile modulus and elongation at break. There was not any difference between tensile modulus of neat PP and PPCNCSD-5. The PPCNCSFD2-5 samples showed an increase in strength of greater than 20% compared to the pure PP or the PPCNCSD-5. The modulus of samples incorporating PCNCSFD1-5 43% higher than the modulus of PP. Adding spray dried CNC agglomerates directly to the PP did not show any enhancement of the PP modulus. Since a higher stiffness is desirable in many applications, the increase in modulus due to incorporation of spray freeze dried CNC agglomerates is promising and can be advantageous. As expected, the elongation at break is lowered with the addition of the reinforcement. Addition of large amount of nanofiller could reduce the viscous response or plastic deformability of a polymer matrix, while enhancing the elastic response. Consequently it induces brittleness character to the polymer matrix. Moreover, the presence of inevitable agglomerate solid particulates could intensify the brittleness due to stress concentration. The sample that was reinforced with spray dried CNC did not show a large decrease. However, samples containing CNCSFD2 had a very low elongation at break, as expected.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Separation of CNC nanoparticles into individual nanoparticles is quite challenging, particularly for CNC nanoparticles in parallel orientation, because the required separation force is higher than the C\C bond force. Thus, polymer chain scission and degradation can take place before particle separation. CNC microstructure depends highly on employed drying techniques. Spray and freeze drying yield a dense structure. The former produces smaller particles with spherical shape, while larger particles with flake structure are produced by the latter. On the other hand, spray freeze drying is a better technique to control structure of CNC particles in the resulting powder. The shape and internal structure of CNCSFD particles depend on CNC aqueous concentration prior to spray freeze drying. In the low concentration regime (b 2 wt.%) a filament-like agglomerate morphology, including interconnected nano-scale fibers, is obtained. At higher concentrations, foam-like spherical particles are formed.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Agglomerate strength and polymer melt infiltration time are both reduced as porosity increases. According to this study, spray freeze dried CNC has higher potential for realizing a good degree of dispersion within polymer matrices in the production of nanocomposites and other nano-structured products. Experimental results confirm better dispersion of spray freeze dried CNC in PP than those prepared by spray and freeze dried techniques. Low frequency complex viscosity and storage modulus of PP were significantly increased by addition of CNCSFD. Moreover, adding CNCSFD with filament-like agglomerate structure increased 20% tensile strength and 43% tensile modulus of PP.'^^xsd:string .
