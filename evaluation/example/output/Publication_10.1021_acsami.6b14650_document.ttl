onner:paragraphText 'Bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibers represent an emerging class of highly crystalline bionanofibers with high intrinsic mechanical properties. The remarkable nanofibers with oriented structure and strong interfibrillar interactions can realize highperformance materials. In this study, we demonstrated that macrofibers based on aligned BC nanofibers could be prepared by wet spinning and drawing procedures. The relationship between process conditions, structure, and mechanical properties of macrofibers were investigated. The obtained macrofibers exhibited Young\'s modulus of 16.4 GPa and tensile strength of 248.6 MPa under the optimum process conditions, in which nanofibers displayed a high degree of alignment. Furthermore, we enhanced the interfacial interactions between nanofibers and obtained better mechanical performance by multivalent ion cross-linking. After exchanging the monovalent Na + by Fe 3+ , the dried macrofiber reached Young\'s modulus of 22.9 GPa and tensile strength of 357.5 MPa. Particularly, the resulting macrofibers still maintained good mechanical properties with Young\'s modulus of 15.9 GPa and tensile strength of 262.2 MPa in the wet condition. This research provided a good method to fabricate macrofibers from BC nanofibers with good properties by continuous wet-spinning process. These macrofibers can be easily functionalized and have promising potential applications in smart textiles, biosensor, and structural reinforcement.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Sustainable and high-performance alternatives based on renewable resources are intensely needed because of exhausted petroleum feedstock and environmental issues.  Cellulose is an almost inexhaustible polymer resource on earth and expected to meet the increasing demand for petroleum-replacing products.  Cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) form a remarkable emerging class of nature-derived nanomaterials due to its extraordinary mechanical properties.  Crystalline cellulose has greater axial elastic modulus than Kevlar and is 2−3 times higher than that of glass fibers.  CNFs also have high aspect ratio, low density, and reactive surface of hydroxyl groups that facilitates chemical functionality.  In general, controllability of architecture for CNFs is significant in applications related to biosensor, electronics, optics, microengineering, and electrocatalysts.  In such cases, the additional benefit of improved mechanical characteristics with aligned CNFs might be realized.  However, one bottleneck in fully realizing the potential of these bionanofibers is to master water-borne processing and find ways to align these anisotropic bionanofibers inside a final material to maximize and control directional mechanical and functional properties.  Several techniques have been used in attempts to control the alignment of CNFs. Compared with magnetic  or electric  field method, shear orientation is simple and has a greater potential for industrial-scale production.  Spinning is a promising and efficient way in practice for uniaxial orientation of nanofibers under shear force. The orientation of nanofibers would be fixed immediately because of a fast dehydration of nanofiber dispersion.  Nanofibers isolated from soft wood,  tunicate,  chitin,  and banana rachis pulp  have been spun into fibers, and their mechanical properties exceed those of typical, nonoriented nanopapers. Besides the orientation, the structure and the interaction among nanofibers may be the other factors affecting the mechanical properties of the macrofibers. Especially in high-moisture environment, hydrogen bonds are weakened; thus, the mechanical properties of water-bone macrofibers would decrease substantially. It is of great importance to systematically investigate the preparation of macrofibers with high mechanical properties.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Unlike plant cellulose, bacterial cellulose (BC) does not contain collateral biogenic compounds such as lignin, hemicelluloses, and pectin. It also has a unique mechanism in the synthesis of chain molecules followed by a subtly self-assembled process from subfibrils to fibrillar ribbons (50−80 nm), which are 200 times finer than cotton fibers.  Thus, BC do not need excess homogenizing and have less energy consumption for obtaining individual nanofibers due to intrinsic nanostructures. As a type of natural bio-nanomaterial, BC nanofibers show outstanding modulus.  The reported axial elastic modulus, E <sub>A</sub> = 78 ± 17 GPa and E <sub>A</sub> = 114 GPa, respectively, were measured by atomic force microscopy 3 pt bend and Raman.  Compared with nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), BC nanofibers have large aspect ratio (30−50 nm wide, 6−10 nm height, 1−9 μm in length) as well as high crystallinity (up to 84−89%).  It is predicted that directional mechanical and functional properties of superior materials can be controlled and maximized by aligning these thin and long crystalline entities with proper structure by suitable processing conditions.'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'So far, the main interest in BC nanofibers focuses on generating strong nanopapers, nanocomposites, or robust foams and aerogels.  However, aligned BC nanofiberbased macrofibers have not been reported. This work reported the fabrication of macrofibers based on BC nanofibers by continuous wet-spinning process. The relationship between process conditions, structure, and mechanical properties of macrofibers were investigated. Two-dimensional (2D) X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were used to quantitatively measure the degree of orientation. The relationship between the structure and the mechanical properties of macrofibers were investigated. The resulting macrofibers with enhanced mechanical properties and stabilization in high humidity were achieved by multivalent ions cross-linking bridges between the oxygen-containing groups.'^^xsd:string .

As shown in Figure , the amount of carboxylate groups formed from the primary hydroxyl groups of cellulose increased with the amount of NaClO added in suspension, where oxidation time of 1 h was applied at room temperature and pH 10.5. The carboxylate groups were further formed up to ∼0.65 mmol/g and unchanged around 0.3 mmol/g when the addition of NaClO up to 3 mmol per gram of cellulose. Similarly, the amount of carboxylate increased very slowly after 1 h of oxidation time by addition of 3 mmol of NaClO in the cellulose slurry (Figure ). Thus, carboxylate content in the water-insoluble fractions are difficult to exceed a certain level even by the excess NaClO addition or oxidation time. The maximum content of C6-oxidized groups of BC is similar to cotton,  and it is lower than that of wood cellulose with carboxylate content of 1−1.5 mmol/g.  That means the degree of oxidation for BC is lower than that of wood cellulose.

The rapid coagulation during the initial preparation of the fibers in acetone can lead to some porosity in macrofibers. As shown in Figure −c, the spun fibers with 1.8, 3.6, and 5.4 wt % nanofibers suspension at 18.9 m/min show different structures. Less porosity and more compactibility is observed with high concentrations. This is because the macroscale structure originates from aggregation during the solvent exchange in the coagulation bath, happening from outside to inside. So nanofibers from high-concentration suspension would move less upon dehydration in the acetone coagulation bath due to higher viscosity.'^^xsd:string .

As shown in Figure , the reflections corresponding to (200) and (11 ̅ 0) are present in the ring  pattern, indicating the random orientation of the nanofibers in BC film. However, the diffractogram in Figure  shows a different diagram with arc pattern of (11 ̅ 0) and (200) reflections, suggesting an improved alignment of the crystallites along the longitudinal axis of the fiber. It has been reported that the distribution along the (200) arc in the 2D pattern was used to quantify the alignment of the nanofibers.  So we traced the orientation using the crystal (200) reflection arising from the nanofibers. Table  displays the azimuthal intensity profiles of the mentioned reflections at different conditions. The degree of alignment was calculated using two methods: (i) the orientation index defined and (ii) the order parameter (more details in the Experimental Section). Both parameters π and S range from 0 to 1, with unity corresponding to perfect alignment, whereas zero corresponds to a random orientation of the nanofibers.  Two different methods show a consistent result that there is an increase in the orientation as the spinning rate increases at all concentrations. In addition, it is also seen that alignment of nanofibers increased with lower concentration suspension at the same extrusion rate.'^^xsd:string .

However, as the nanofibers concentration increases, the nanofiber−nanofiber interaction competes with the external force, leading to lower alignment of nanofibers.

onner:paragraphText 'It is worth noting that alignment of nanofibers is not the only important effect for mechanical performance. According to the data in Table , the macrofiber obtained with higher extrusion rate of nanofibers at the same concentration shows the increase of nanofibers alignment in longitudinal axis, which possesses higher tensile and elastic modulus. However, highly aligned fiber in low concentration does not show good mechanical performance. For example, at the same spinning rate of 18.9 m/ min, the macrofibers show decreased alignment and a significant improvement of strength and module when concentrations are increased from 1.8 to 5.4 wt %. This is because the higher concentrations may lead to increase of nanofiber−nanofiber contacting points and nanofiber interactions from the longitudinal axis of fiber, while low concentrations result in porosity or loose structure of the materials, which would considerably decrease the mechanical properties of the macrofibers. Porosity has a negative effect on mechanical properties of nanostructure materials in various studies.  Lower porosity correlates with reduced specific surface area, which can be interpreted as decreased segment length between nanofiber−nanofiber bond sites. As a result, low concentrations with porous structure lead to lower modulus and decreased stress. The macrofiber in 5.4 wt % concentration with spinning rate of 18.9 m/min shows compact structure and good mechanical properties. It is predicted that such cohesive fibers can achieve higher values of tensile and elastic modulus upon more efficient alignment of the nanofibers. For such longer nanofibers (more than 5 μm), it is difficult to align them with higher speed due to persisting colloidal entanglement. The maximum alignment of nanofibers is expected by using additional post drawing.'^^xsd:string .

A gain of mechanical properties due to wet-stretching demonstrates that it is a more effective process to induce orientation of nanofibers in this kind of material.

WAXD confirmed that the orientation index of nanofibers was enhanced with increased spinning rate and decreased nanofiber concentrations. SEM showed the spun macrofiber with 5.4 wt % CNF concentration had a denser structure compared with lower concentrations. The dense structure and high orientation of nanofibers contributed to good mechanical properties. Higher orientation in cohesive fibers can be obtained by using additional post drawing to achieve higher values of tensile and elastic modulus. Fibers with highest drawing ratio of 0.2 display a high degree of alignment of ∼0.7.
