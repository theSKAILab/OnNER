onner:paragraphText 'Cellulose, a fascinating biopolymer and the most common organic compound on earth, is comprehensively reviewed. Details of its crystalline phases are given, starting with a description of molecular and supramolecular structures, including the hydrogen bond systems. Sources of this ubiquitous biopolymer are mentioned, with attention to the special properties of bacterially synthesized nanofibrous cellulose. Nanostructures obtained by disintegration of cellulose fibers (top-down approach) yielding nano-or microfibrillated cellulose and cellulose whiskers are the basis for novel materials with extraordinary properties. Moreover, nanofibers and nanoparticles can be made by special techniques applying the bottom-up approach. Efficient systems to dissolve cellulose by destruction of the hydrogen bond systems using ionic liquids and systems based on polar aprotic solvent and salt are described. Novel cellulose derivatives are available by chemical modification under heterogeneous or homogeneous conditions, depending on the cellulose reactivity. In particular, unconventional nucleophilic displacement reactions yielding products for high-value applications are highlighted. Novel amino cellulose derivatives showing fully reversible aggregation behavior and nanostructure formation on various materials are the focus of interest. Finally, "click chemistry" for the synthesis of novel cellulose derivatives is discussed.'^^xsd:string .

Nowadays, there are various processes used to isolate cellulose, for example, the alkaline, bisulfite, and sulfate (kraft-) processes, in combination with thermal and mechanical treatments.

onner:paragraphText 'Cellulose is distributed throughout nature in plants, animals, algae, fungi, and minerals (Fig. ). However, the major source of cellulose is plant fiber. Cellulose contributes approximately 40% to the carbon fraction in plants, serving as structuring element within the complex architecture of their cell walls. Cellulose can occur in pure form in plants but it is usually accompanied by hemicelluloses, lignins, and comparably small amounts of extractives. Wood contains about 40-50 wt% cellulose. Comparable amounts can be found in bagasse , bamboo , straw (40-50 wt%), and even higher in flax (70-80 wt%), hemp , jute , kapok , and ramie (70-75 wt %). Cotton is a fairly pure cellulose source, containing more than 90 wt% . An impressive amount of cellulose is produced each year, not only in wood fiber from trees (ca. 1,750,000 kt world production) but also in annual plants such as bamboo (10,000 kt), cotton linters , jute (2,300 kt), flax (830 kt), sisal (378 kt), hemp (214 kt), and ramie (100 kt) . In addition, several fungi and green algae produce cellulose (e.g., Valonia ventricosa, Chaetamorpha melagonicum, Glaucocystis) and some (marine) animals such as ascidians contain cellulose in their outer membrane. Moreover, bacteria of the genera Gluconacetobacter, Agrobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, and Sarcina can synthesize bacterial cellulose from glucose and various other carbon sources . Bacterial cellulose, which is produced directly as a fibrous network, contains no lignin, pectin, hemicelluloses, or other biogenic products; it is very highly crystalline and possesses a high degree of polymerization (DP).'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Microcrystalline cellulose (MC) is a fine, white, and odorless crystalline powder (commercial products include Avicel <super>®</super> , Heweten <super>®</super> , Microcel <super>®</super> , Nilyn <super>®</super> , and Novagel <super>®</super> ) used in pharmaceutical (tablet binder), food (rheology control), and paper applications as well as in composite manufacturing . MC is commercially produced by treatment of biomass with aqueous sodium hydroxide to remove other constituents , followed by acidic hydrolysis. During hydrolysis, the DP of cellulose decreases with hydrolysis time until reaching a plateau value called "level off DP" (LODP), which ranges between 25 and 300 depending on the cellulose source . The hydrolysis takes place in the less crystalline regions, leaving a solid residue that is water-insoluble and crystalline. As a result of the motion freedom of the hydrolyzed crystallites, structures are produced that have larger dimensions than the original microfibrils  forming a stable aqueous dispersion upon vigorous stirring. However, colloidal destabilization of the small crystalline domains can occur upon removal of acid by dialysis followed by spraydrying . In such dry form, MC morphology varies from stubby to fibrillar. Importantly, sulfate half-ester moieties are introduced on the microcrystals (sulfur content 0.5-2%) when sulfuric acid is used for hydrolysis . The negative charge developed in aqueous media by these groups is the main contributor to colloidal stability of the dispersion, and its viscosity has been found to strongly depend on the charge density . HCl is the hydrolytic medium of choice if MC is to be produced for applications that require the absence of electrostatic charges (e.g., in order to enhance enzyme interactions, binding, and attack). Such HCl-hydrolyzed MC is uncharged and can be of similar shape and size to that from sulfuric acid hydrolysis (Fig. ). Concentrated dispersions of MC obtained with HCl show thixotropy (concentration &gt;5%) whereas antithixotropic behavior is displayed at lower concentrations (&lt;0.3%). MC cellulose crystallites (and also cellulose nanocrystals or whiskers, see Sect. 4.2) self-assemble in water into chiral nematic phases of a given pitch, P, that reflect circularly polarized light of the same handedness. The value of P is in the order of the wavelength of visible light, giving rise to interesting interactions under illumination. Furthermore, above a critical concentration the cellulose crystallites evolve spontaneously into chiral nematic liquid crystals in water, which upon drying form regularly twisted fibril layers that resemble the structural organization that evolves in nature .'^^xsd:string .

onner:paragraphText 'Intense hydrolysis of cellulose results in crystallites that assemble into rigid rodlike cellulose particles, namely cellulose whiskers, after treatment with ultrasound . Their preparation is also possible using high-energy mechanical treatments that cleave the amorphous parts by mechanical disintegration of a cellulose suspension. An enzymatically produced precursor yields whiskers in a more efficient two-step process . Enzymatic hydrolysis is milder than the more aggressive acid hydrolysis and yields whiskers that are relatively longer and more entangled, resulting in a hydrogel network that possesses much greater strength. Cellulose nanocrystals take rodlike shapes with a typical width of a few nanometers and length of the order of hundreds of nanometers . Such dimensions depend on the cellulose source and amorphous cellulose content, and are thus influenced by the conditions used during hydrolysis. Cellulose nanocrystals display a small number of defects and show no signs of chain folding. A large elastic modulus (~150 GPa) and strength (~7 GPa) have been typically calculated or determined for cellulose nanocrystals, which also possess a very low thermal expansion coefficient (~10 <super>À7</super> K <super>À1</super> ) .

onner:paragraphText 'The rigid and rodlike nature of cellulose I nanocrystals leads to macroscopic birefringence under observation with crossed polarizers . At low concentrations, cellulose nanocrystals are randomly oriented in water and appear as oval or spherical features . As the concentration is increased, the nanocrystals selfassemble along a vector to yield a typical cholesteric liquid crystalline phase. The chiral nematic order can be retained upon removal of water and results in iridescent films, the color of which can be easily tuned by changing the salt concentration, pH, and temperature of the suspension . At higher ionic strength (e.g., by addition of HCl, NaCl, or KCl), the electrical double-layer effect is screened out and the chiral interactions become stronger. The counter-ion also effects the interactions between particles. In the presence of protons, the cellulose suspensions form ordered phases at the lowest critical concentration. Application of a magnetic field during drying of cellulose films results in perfect orientation of the whiskers, leading to colored materials that can be used as security paper. The color change depends on the viewing angle, which is useful for production of optically variable coatings and inks. Figure  shows different domains of the cellulose nanocrystals, suggesting an ordered phase (Fig. ) and a well-defined cholesteric phase (Fig. ) . Under an external magnetic field, small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments indicate that the cholesteric axis of the chiral nematic phase aligns with the magnetic field . Along the cholesteric axis, the distance between the cellulose particles is shorter than perpendicular to it. This evidence suggests a helical twist of the cellulose whiskers.'^^xsd:string .

These aggregates were described as forming a "fringed" micellar structure (Fig. ) composed of laterally aligned chains, forming a rather compact and possibly geometrically anisotropic core that is immiscible in the solvent. The solvated amorphous cellulose chains form "coronas" at both ends of the particles . The thickness of the coronas and the number of molecular chains forming the aggregate increase as a function of both cellulose concentration and the interfacial tension between the solvent and particle core . Monodisperse solutions of cellulose molecules with small (Fig. ), and large (Fig. ) DP produced typical features. The length of the short cellulose chain is practically equal to its persistent length, (i.e., there is neither chain coiling nor interaction with other chains). The flexibility of the long chain polymer allows the formation of strong intramolecular hydrogen bonds, provided that the OH groups reside for some time within a "critical distance" of each other (ca. 0.3 nm), sufficient for van der Waals forces to operate (Fig. ) . As a result, the properties of cellulose (DP, crystallinity, and concentration) affect its solution state and, hence, its derivatization. For the same cellulose, the accessibility of the OH groups increases with decreasing solution concentration.

onner:paragraphText 'Although a wide variety of solvents for cellulose have been developed and investigated in recent years, only a few have shown the potential for controlled and homogeneous functionalization of the polysaccharide (Table ) . Limitations to the application of solvents result from high toxicity, high reactivity of the solvents leading to undesired side reactions, and loss of solubility during reactions. The latter results in inhomogeneous mixtures through formation of gels and pastes, which are difficult to mix, and even through formation of de-swollen particles of low reactivity, which settle out in the reaction medium. Homogeneous reaction conditions give the opportunity for esterification with state of the art reagents, for example, after in situ activation of carboxylic acids, which is characterized by reacting the carboxylic acid with a reagent to form an intermediate, highly reactive carboxylic acid derivative. The carboxylic acid derivative can be formed prior to reaction with the polysaccharide or converted directly in a one-pot reaction. Modification of cellulose with carboxylic acids after in situ activation has made a broad variety of new esters accessible, because common reactive derivatives such as anhydrides or chlorides are not accessible for numerous acids (e.g., unsaturated or hydrolytically instable acids). The mild reaction conditions applied for in situ activation avoids side reactions such as pericyclic reactions, hydrolysis, and oxidation . For example, a reaction with enormous potential for cellulose modification is the homogeneous one-pot reaction after in situ activation of carboxylic acids with N,N <super>0</super> -carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), which has been well known in bioorganic chemistry since 1962 . The reactive imidazolide of the acid is generated, and the by-products CO <sub>2</sub> and imidazole are nontoxic (Fig. ). The pH is almost constant during the conversion, resulting in negligible chain degradation. In comparison to dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), the application of CDI is much more efficient, avoids most of the side reactions, and allows the use of DMSO (a good solvent for most complex carboxylic acids).'^^xsd:string .

A broad variety of cellulose derivatives are accessible, as summarized in Table . The S <sub>N</sub> reaction occurs almost exclusively at the primary position of the repeating unit, most probably for steric reasons. The S <sub>N</sub> of a tosylate moiety occurs via a S <sub>N</sub> 2 mechanism (i.e., a transition state appears containing five atoms that is hardly formed at the secondary positions of the modified AGU).'^^xsd:string .

Moreover, di-and oligoamines provide different properties such as pH value and charge distribution, control of hydrophilic/lipophilic balance, and redox-chromogenic properties.

onner:paragraphText 'Cellulose is the most important renewable resource and a unique polymer in terms of its structure and properties. Because of its unique properties, cellulose can serve as starting material for various products and processes for a sustainable world and the development of a country\'s bioeconomy. Physical and chemical modification reactions yielding fibers, film, sponges, and cellulose ethers and esters are of high commercial importance today. However, research and development in the field of nanostructuring of cellulose and cellulose derivatives, homogeneous chemistry with cellulose applying various solvents (including molten salts, ionic liquids, and water-based systems) can open new avenues for product design with modern organic chemistry. It can be expected that homogeneous phase chemistry will enter the technical scale in the future. Not only chemical modification of the bulk, but also surface modification (i.e., products with low DS) can provide important novel materials. Last but not least, as discussed in this review paper, depending on its nano-and microstructured architectures, versatile characteristics of the biopolymer cellulose can be achieved and addressed to a specific function. Consequently, cellulose is a promising and broadly applicable material not only (as commonly known) in the paper and textile industries but also for medical and pharmaceutical devices, among others. The applications of nano-and microstructured cellulose can further be broadened by chemical and physical surface treatments.'^^xsd:string .
